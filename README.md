## Overview
The Interactive Garden with Notes is a web-based application that allows users to create a virtual garden, plant various types of plants, add notes to each plant, and interact with the garden through watering and seasonal changes. The garden is designed with a charming, cottagecore aesthetic and includes features like music playback, critter animations, and weather effects.

## Features
- **Plant Selection**: Choose from various plants like seedlings, carrots, tomatoes, herbs, lettuce, peppers, sunflowers, strawberries, onions, and tulips.
- **Garden Display**: Plant your selected plants in a grid layout and add notes to each plant.

- **Seasonal Themes**: Toggle between different seasonal themes (spring, summer, fall, winter) which change the background and plant colors.
- **Music**: Play or pause garden sounds/music to enhance the ambiance.
